# Swish

[Live Demo](https://jinfull.github.io/swish/)

Swish is a tool for tracking NBA player shot charts and how their shot selection evolves over time. 

Swish is a completely front-end based project relying on JavaScript and D3.js with Python as the scripting language to generate the project's "seed" data.

## Features
* Dynamic updating of rookie and final seasons of selected players
* Automatic transitions highlighting year-to-year changes in player's shot chart (with onClick listener to remove transitions)
* Uses Python to read from official NBA Stats API and output files in desired format
* Uses D3.js library to select, append, and chart elements from coerced data
